To make it work, you need to get a Context.IO API key: http://context.io/#signup.

You also need to create a conf/conf.keys.php which has the following content:

<?php
define('CONTEXTIO_CONSUMER_KEY','your-context.io-consumer-key');
define('CONTEXTIO_CONSUMER_SECRET','your-context.io-consumer-secret');
define('SITE_KEY','a-random-string-used-to-password-hashing');
?>
